/*
When doing these tasks, it's recommended using fmt.Println or fmt.Printf to test the output of your code to make sure
it works correctly. This will usually entail console logging the answer directly or console logging the
invocation (call) of the function so when it returns a value, that value will be logged to the console.
An example of this would be:  console.log(theFunction(value1,value2))

Task 1b - Values (not auto tested)

Do the following:
   1. Declare two variables and assign them values (good names for these might be firstThing and secondThing)
   2. Use a conditional to check the value of the 1st variable versus the value assigned to the 2nd variable
   3. Change the value of the 1st variable if the conditional in step 2 is true
   4. Print the value of the 1st variable

1. Create a new variable that randomly generates the computer's choice, this must not be done inside the function
2. Use rand.Intn to determine the computer's choice
3. Make a conditional that changes the variable to "rock", "paper", or "scissors" based on the random number

Use the game function below to do the following:
1. Receive 2 parameters: a string with the user's choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors"
   and the computer's choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
   NOTE: make sure the strings are all lower case or it will not pass the test

2. Return whether the user won, lost, or tied based on these rules of the game described below
   the strings returned need to match these strings below exactly.

   - win should return "you win!"
   - lose should return "you lose!"
   - tie should return "it's a tie"
